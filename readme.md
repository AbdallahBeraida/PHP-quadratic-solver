PHP Quadratic Equation Solver
=============================
A simple quadratic formula solver written in PHP, seperated into modular functions.
Input is accepted in normal quadratic form of ax^2+bx+c=0.
I'll try and add a feature to graph the equations in pure PHP also, but we'll see how time goes.
